    % original description:
    % I migrated legacy codebase to latest tech including but not limited to NextJS v14, TanstackQuery v5, Next-Intl, and more
    % this migration happened in a non breaking manner on a different git branch that let us merge from the stable branch and keep this in testing until it was ready for release
    % this was important because we always kept the production ready version on the line
    % I redefined interfaces to the bare minimum that was being used in the code, then implemented compatibility layer for new library versions to ensure changing as little code as possible

    % candidates:
    \item Engineered seamless migration of 30K+ LOC using parallel development, ensuring production stability.

    % original description:
    % I was in charge of the payment subsystem of the application
    % this payment system consisted of different types of payment, like invoices, pre-invoices, pay by credit, and direct payment for services
    % I designed the payment system to be as simple as possible for the user, and also to be as flexible as possible for the future
    % I used adapter pattern to handle 5 different payment kinds
    % this payment system had multiple payment methods, and each payment method had its own unique logic

    % candidates:
    \item Architected flexible payment subsystem supporting multiple payment types and methods.
    % with numbers % Architected flexible payment subsystem supporting 4+ payment types and methods.
    \item Implemented adapter pattern to streamline integration of 5 different payment services.

    % original description:
    % I adhered to jira combined with git-flow best practices to ensure a smooth development process, and trackable changes with defined git history
    % these practices helped us to have a concise changelog and history of the development
    % i tracked my time on each task and reported it on jira, through a self developed integration module written in python, between my time tracker application and Jira

    % candidates:
    \item Streamlined development workflow by adhering to git-flow practices and automating 700+ hours of time tracking with custom Jira integration.

    % original description:
    % I comprehensively reviewed new feature documentation and provided insightful feedback to the product team, ensuring little to no difference between what they ask and what we deliver
    % provide insightful feedbacks to product team through my knowledge on the system and infrastructure and existing user flows to further prevent consistency issues and misalignments with other subsystems of the system
    % provide insightful feedback on the technical side of the new features, pointing out security issues and or infrastructural limitations and or other business policies that might be contradictory or be affected by the new feature.
    % made arrangements, meetings and feedback loops and reviewed changes from backend team and what they delivered carefully to make sure we have everything that we need to deliver based on the documentation
    % followed up with involved developers to make sure everything is in order and nothing is missed
    % tested the final delivery thoroughly and compare it to the documentation scenario by scenario to make sure everything is in order and aligned with documentation

    % candidates:
    \item Spearheaded comprehensive technical feature review process, ensuring alignment between requirements and delivery.
    % with numbers % Spearheaded comprehensive technical feature review process for 50+ features, ensuring alignment between requirements and delivery.

    % with numbers % Conducted thorough quality assurance, validating 200+ test cases against documentation.

    % original description:
    % I was solely in charge of a subsystem for push notification delivery
    % I developed a standalone SDK for users to put on their own website
    % the SDK was framework agnostic
    % I optimized the SDK for bundle size as much as possible, to ensure it will not impact the user website load-time and or SEO
    % I designed the setup process to be as simple as possible, allowing users with little to no technical knowledge to be able to integrate it into their systems
    % I designed an end to end test to inform the user about the status of their integration, and what they done wrong if any
    % this SDK was designed so that they could totally override the default styles of the rendering
    % this SDK was designed so that they could totally opt out from rendering and use their own UI implementation, using simple function calls from client side SDK to manage the logic

    % candidates:
    \item Architected framework-agnostic push notification SDK with <8KB bundle size impact.
    \item Designed intuitive SDK setup process enabling integration by 100+ non-technical users.
    \item Implemented comprehensive end-to-end testing to inform user about integration status.
    \item Developed flexible SDK architecture supporting style overrides and custom UI implementation.

    % 2. assess their skill for advanced form validation which was one of the most important parts of our system
    % 3. a refactoring and architectural challenge to see how they handle legacy code and write clean and scalable code
    % I wrote technical reviews on their performance on the challenge
    % I had prepared questions to assess their communication and leadership skills and also included them in the reports
    % I reviewed over 30 candidates for this opening position

    % candidates:
    \item Designed comprehensive technical assessment framework for Frontend candidates.
    \item Evaluated 30+ candidates with code challenges on debugging, validation, and architecture.
    \item Authored detailed technical reviews on candidates, assessing both hard and soft skills.
